# Fahrenheit_with_Celsius_Android_Widget
An android widget written in Java that takes Location data and uses it to retrieve your local temperature from api.weather.gov then displays it in both Fahrenheit and Celsius. I made this for users like me who are accustomed to one unit of measurement (Farenheit) but want to get used to using the other.
